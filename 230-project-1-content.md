# Tank's Pacifist Run Proposal
## High Concept
A top-down game inspired from the classic arcade game, "Tank" with a twist. The object is to dodge the other tanks attacks for a limited time without shooting or killing them. The time limits will get longer as the level increases. This game will discourage the player from beating the game without killing.
